# Smart-beta
This project aims to design an index investment strategy leveraging the Fama-French 5-factor model while integrating advanced quantitative techniques such as mean Mean-Variance Optimization and the Markov Switching Model for dynamic weight allocation. The goal is to create a robust portfolio that maximizes returns and minimizes risks by systematically adjusting factor weights based on historical performance and prevailing market regimes.
